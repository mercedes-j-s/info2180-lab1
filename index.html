 <p>I was born and raised in Kingston Jamaica. I previously attend Holy Childhood High and now attend the University of the West Indies as a second year computing Student. After graduating, I hope to give back to Jamaica with the skills I obtain with this degree. I would also like to pursue a postgraduate degree in Computing in the future. I am interested in Web development because I find it fascinating how websites and webpages are created.</p>
